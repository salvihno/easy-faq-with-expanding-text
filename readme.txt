Easily create a Frequently Asked Questions page with answers that slide down when the questions are clicked. No need for a shortcode.

== Description ==

Why have a dry Frequently Asked Questions page when you could have an easy interface with animations? This plugin allows you to create an FAQ page (or pages) with hidden answers that appear when a question is clicked. Anyone who can use the WordPress GUI editor can use this plugin to create the FAQ pages. No need for a shortcode or other coding needed!

To create your FAQ page, just include "Frequently Asked Questions" or "FAQ" somwhere in the title. In the content of the page, select a heading style for questions and keep answers in the paragraph or in lists.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'easy-faq-by-bgentry' folder `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on FAQ Admin Page in the left-side menu on the dashboard for detailed instructions
